It was raining the day Milo learned how to be brave.

He was seven, small for his age, with shoelaces that never stayed tied and a backpack too big for his narrow shoulders. Every afternoon after school, he walked straight to the hospital instead of home. He’d sit in the same blue plastic chair, legs swinging, counting the ceiling tiles while the machines beside his mother’s bed hummed and blinked like tiny, tired stars.

His mom used to hum while she cooked. She’d twirl him around the kitchen and call him her “little moon,” because, she said, even when the world was dark, he still glowed. But now her voice was softer, like it was traveling from very far away.

One evening, he climbed carefully onto the edge of her bed. “I got an A in spelling,” he whispered, pulling the paper from his backpack. The red ink circled the top like a proud halo. “You said if I kept trying, I could spell ‘beautiful.’ I did. See?”

Her eyes opened just a little. She smiled the way flowers do when they’re almost done blooming. “I always knew you could,” she breathed.

He wanted to ask her not to leave. The words pressed against his ribs, sharp and desperate. But he had heard the doctors in the hallway. He had seen the way his father cried in the parking lot when he thought no one was watching.

So instead, Milo did the bravest thing he could think of.

He took her hand, small fingers wrapping around the hand that once held him steady while he learned to walk. “It’s okay, Mommy,” he said, his voice shaking like the rain on the window. “If you’re tired… you can sleep. I’ll be your brave boy.”

A tear slipped from the corner of her eye, tracing the lines illness had drawn on her face. “My little moon,” she whispered.

That night, while the storm whispered against the glass, the machines went quiet.

At the funeral, Milo stood on a stool to reach the microphone. The church felt too big, too empty without her laugh filling it. He unfolded a wrinkled piece of paper from his pocket.

“My mom said I glow in the dark,” he read, blinking hard. “But she was the one who wasn’t afraid of the dark. She stayed with me when I had nightmares. So… if she’s somewhere dark right now, I hope she knows I’m not scared anymore. Because she taught me how to be brave.”

His father covered his face and wept.

Years passed. Milo grew taller. His shoes finally fit. But every time it rained, he would stand by the window and listen. And sometimes, in the hush between thunder and silence, he would hum softly—off-key, just like she used to—so that wherever she was, she wouldn’t feel alone.

And even on the darkest nights, he glowed.
